# TrainAApp

The group project as a final task of the Angular course from RS School. We had 3 weeks to gather a team and complete the project.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to develop a platform for managing train trips. User roles include anonymous users, authorized users, and a resource manager, each with distinct responsibilities.

### Roles

- **Guest**: Can search for routes and find trips, but before booking, they are required to authorize.
- **Authorized User**: Can book trips and view their past trips.
- **Admin**: Has the authority to create trips and manage routes and schedules.

## My Contribution to the Project

- Analyzed project requirements and created actionable tasks for the team.
- Contributed to the project setup by integrating the Husky pre-commit hook, ensuring Prettier and lint rules were enforced before committing changes.
- Integrated NgRx into the project and proposed a state management architecture tailored to our specific needs.
- Developed the login page according to the projectâ€™s requirements.
- Implemented admin pages for managing carriages, routes, and rides based on specified requirements.
- Conducted code reviews to ensure quality and maintain best practices.
